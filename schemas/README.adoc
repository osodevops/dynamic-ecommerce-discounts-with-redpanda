= Schema implementation and testing
Paulo Jer√¥nimo
include::common/head.adoc[]

== Introduction

Here you have details about the schema for the generated discount event.

As implemented by the link:../discounts-processor[], there are two possible discount formats.

[[discount-event]]
A *Discount Event* can be exemplified by these two examples:

[,json]
.link:../discounts-processor/e2e/data/MultiProduct.json[]:
----
include::MultiProduct.json[]
----

[,json]
.link:../discounts-processor/e2e/data/MostViewedMultipleViewsPerProduct.json[]:
----
include::MostViewedMultipleViewsPerProduct.json[]
----

So, the <<schema>> must be able to attend both formats.

[[schema]]
== Custom schema implementation

The schema for <<discount-events,for the events above>> is definined below.

[,json]
.link:./com.snowplow/shopper_discount_applied/jsonschema/1-0-0[]:
----
include::1-0-0[]
----

== Registering the custom schema in Iglu Server

The script link:./register.sh[] is responsible for registering the custom discount event schema in the Iglu Server. It uses a simple `curl` command to POST the schema file (located at `com.snowplow/shopper_discount_applied/jsonschema/1-0-0`) to the Iglu Server's `/api/schemas` endpoint, authenticating with the API key.

For demonstration purposes, the Iglu Server configuration (see link:../docker/compose.snowplow.yaml[]) is set to use the "dummy" database mode, which means all schemas are stored only in memory. **Any schema registered will be lost if the Iglu Server container is restarted.** This setup is ideal for local development and testing, but not for production.

To register the schema, simply run the `register.sh` script.

== Validating events against the schema in Iglu Server

After registering the schema, you can use the link:./validate_events.sh[] script (which calls link:./validate_events.js[]) to verify two things:

. That the schema is actually available in the Iglu Server (the script fetches it via HTTP).
. That your discount event examples (such as link:../discounts-processor/e2e/data/MultiProduct.json[] and link:../discounts-processor/e2e/data/MostViewedMultipleViewsPerProduct.json[]) are valid according to the registered schema.

The validation script will:

. Fetch the schema from the Iglu Server using the configured URL and API key.
. Validate each event file against the fetched schema using the Ajv JSON Schema validator (with support for formats like `"date-time"`).
. Print a message for each event indicating whether it is valid or, if not, what validation errors were found.

To run the validation, simply run the `validate_events.sh` script.
It will ensures your schema is correctly registered and your events conform to it, simulating the validation that will occur in the Snowplow pipeline.

== Demonstration

Inside the `schemas` directory, with all other containers stopped, run the following commands:

[,console]
----
# Start the Iglu Server:
$ (cd ../docker; docker compose up -d iglu-server)

# Register the schema:
$ ./register.sh 
{"message":"Schema created","updated":false,"location":"iglu:com.snowplow/shopper_discount_applied/jsonschema/1-0-0","status":201}

# Validate the events:
$ ./validate_events.sh 
Schema fetched from: http://localhost:8180/api/schemas/com.snowplow/shopper_discount_applied/jsonschema/1-0-0
OK: MultiProduct.json is valid.
OK: MostViewedMultipleViewsPerProduct.json is valid.

# Stop the Iglu Server:
$ (cd ../docker; docker compose down -v)
