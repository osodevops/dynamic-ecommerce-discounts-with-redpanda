= Processors Rules

This section describes the rules and business logic implemented by the two discount processors.

[[processor-configuration]]
== Processor Configuration

The `DiscountsProcessor` provides flexible configuration options for both processors:

* Both processors can be enabled simultaneously
* Either processor can be disabled independently
* At least one processor must be enabled for the system to function
* Configuration is managed through the `ConfigurationManager`

This flexibility allows for different business scenarios:

* Running both processors together provides the most comprehensive discount strategy
* Running only the `MostViewedProcessor` can be useful when focusing on product discovery behavior
* Running only the `ContinuousViewProcessor` emphasizes deep product engagement

When running only the `MostViewedProcessor`, it's recommended to:

* Adjust the `processor.continuous-view.min-pings-for-discount` property to a higher value
* This ensures that discounts are only given for products with significant user engagement
* Helps maintain the quality of the discount program while focusing on the most viewed products

[[continuous-view-processor]]
== Continuous View Processor

The `ContinuousViewProcessor` implements the primary discount strategy, which rewards users for continuous engagement with a single product.

=== Rules

* A 10% discount is generated when a user views the same product continuously for 90 seconds
* The viewing time is calculated as:
  * Initial viewing time (when `product_view` occurs)
  * 10-second delay to first ping
  * Each subsequent `page_ping` adds 10 seconds
* Only one discount per user per 5-minute window
* Cooldown period of 5 minutes after receiving any discount

=== Business Value

This processor encourages deep product engagement by rewarding users who spend significant time examining a single product. This behavior often indicates strong purchase intent and can lead to higher conversion rates.

[[most-viewed-processor]]
== Most Viewed Processor

The `MostViewedProcessor` serves as a fallback mechanism when the continuous view criteria aren't met, but the user still shows significant interest in multiple products.

=== Rules

* A 10% discount is generated for the most viewed product within a 5-minute window
* View counting:
** Minimum threshold: 3 views within the window
** Only `page_ping` events count towards view totals
** View duration is calculated using `page_ping` timestamps
* Tiebreaker rules:
** Product with longest total viewing time wins
** If still tied, most recently viewed product wins
* One discount per user per window
* 5-minute cooldown period after receiving any discount

=== Business Value

This processor serves as a valuable fallback for several reasons:

. It captures users who browse multiple products but don't spend enough time on any single one to trigger the continuous view discount
. It rewards product discovery behavior, encouraging users to explore the catalog
. It provides a second chance for discounts when the primary continuous view strategy doesn't apply
. It helps maintain user engagement by offering alternative paths to discounts

=== Relationship with Continuous View Processor

The `MostViewedProcessor` complements the `ContinuousViewProcessor` by:

* Providing an alternative discount path for different user behaviors
* Ensuring users who show interest in multiple products can still receive discounts
* Creating a more comprehensive discount strategy that covers various shopping patterns
* Maintaining user engagement through multiple interaction patterns

This dual-processor approach creates a more robust and flexible discount system that can accommodate different user behaviors while maintaining clear business rules and objectives.
