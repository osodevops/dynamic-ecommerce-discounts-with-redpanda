= DevContainers Configuration
Paulo Jer√¥nimo
include::common/head.adoc[]

== Introduction

This project uses Development Containers (devcontainers) to provide a consistent development environment across different machines and platforms. The configuration ensures that all developers have the same tools and dependencies installed, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.

== Configuration Details

=== Base Image

The project uses Microsoft's Universal DevContainer image as its base:

[source,json]
----
include::devcontainer.json[lines=3]
----

This image comes with many development tools pre-installed, including:

* Git
* nvm (Node Version Manager)
* Basic build tools
* Common Unix utilities

=== VS Code Extensions

The following VS Code extensions are automatically installed:

[source,json]
----
include::devcontainer.json[lines=4..11]
----

=== Port Forwarding

The container automatically forwards port 8080, which is used by the Redpanda Console:

[source,json]
----
include::devcontainer.json[lines=13..15]
----

=== Post-Creation Setup

After the container is created, the `postCreate.sh` script runs automatically to set up the development environment. This script:

1. Updates the system packages and installs tmux:
+
[source,bash]
----
include::postCreate.sh[tag=system-packages]
----

2. Installs Java 21 (Temurin) using SDKMAN:
+
[source,bash]
----
include::postCreate.sh[tag=java-install]
----

3. Installs the LTS version of Node.js and sets it as default:
+
[source,bash]
----
include::postCreate.sh[tag=node-install]
----

== Usage

=== Starting the DevContainer

There are three ways to use this devcontainer:

1. In GitHub Codespaces:
* Click the green "Code" button on the GitHub repository
* Select "Create codespace on main"

2. In VS Code:
* Install the "Remote Development" extension
* Clone the repository
* Press F1 and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

3. Using DevContainer CLI:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Install the CLI
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli

# Start the container
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .

# Open a shell in the container
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . bash
----

=== Verifying the Setup

After the container starts and the setup completes, you can verify the installation:

[source,bash]
----
# Check Java version
java -version

# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Check if tmux is installed
tmux -V
----

== Customization

If you need to modify the development environment:

* Edit `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for container configuration
* Modify `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh` for setup changes
* Update VS Code extensions in the `customizations.vscode.extensions` section of `devcontainer.json`
