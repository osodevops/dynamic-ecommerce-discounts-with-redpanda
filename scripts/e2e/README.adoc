= End-to-End (E2E) Testing

== Introduction

The following <<Steps>> allow you to test this project by automating user behaviour and executing scripts that access the front end through the {Playwright} framework.

If you're unfamiliar with Playwright, the only thing you need to know is that it's like a robot that accesses a website and simulates the behaviour of a real human. However, as a robot, its steps are completely predetermined through automated scripts.

Technically speaking, these Playwright tests are written in this project using {TypeScript}. Additionally, there are some {Bash} and {jq} scripts that assist this process.

So, this is an end-to-end test that almost completely validates the architecture described in the link:../../docs/main/README{outfilesuffix}[main document].
See the <<expected-final-results>> for this test.

<<<
== Prerequisites

=== Change your current directory

. To execute the following commands, from the project's root, you must ensure that your current directory is `scripts/e2e`.

=== Install Playwright and configure it to run in a devcontainer

. We will use more than one terminal to execute the following commands. I will use {Tmux}. Feel free to open terminals however you like.
. Before starting, playwright needs to be installed using these commands:
+
----
$ npx playwright install-deps
$ npx playwright install
----
+
. Since we will be running playwright in a non-interactive environment, run this command:
+
----
$ export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
----

<<<
== Steps

=== Start all the services

. Open another terminal window.
. Start all docker services (if they are not started yet):
+
[,console]
----
$ ../docker/up.sh
----
. Wait until all services are available...
. You can type kbd:[Ctrl+C] on the windows showing the logs for all services. Then, watch only the `discounts-processor` logs through this command:
+
[,console]
----
$ ../docker/logs.sh discounts-processor
----
+
[TIP]
====
Alternatively, running the following commands has the same effect as above:
----
$ cd ../../docker

$ # run the following if you are starting the devcontainer for the first time:
$ ./setup.sh

$ # tip: use --build below only if you changed some code
$ docker compose up --build -d

$ docker compose logs -f discounts-processor
----
====

<<<
=== Testing the ContinuosViewProcessor

. Open another terminal to start testing the "ContinuousView" processor:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./test.sh 
Usage: ./test.sh <test>
Available tests: ContinuousView MostViewed

$ rm -rf data

$ ./test.sh ContinuousView
----
. Wait for the test script to finish. This should take up to 5 minutes since this is an end-to-end test that simulates real user behaviour.

==== Saving and analysing the generated data

. See the generated log for the last command:
+
[,console]
----
$ tree data

$ cat data/ContinuousView.log
----
+
. Save the data generated in the topics:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./save-data.sh ContinuousView

$ cat data/ContinuousView/snowplow-enriched-good.jsonl

$ !! | jq . # <- to see the results pretty formatted.
----
+
. The discount event, if it has been successfully generated, can be viewed with this command:
+
----
$ cat data/ContinuousView/shopper-discounts.jsonl | jq .
----
+
. Use the `summarize.sh` script. It will provide details about the events generated.
.. It executes a small {Kotlin} app to get details about these events.
This app uses the same {Java} code created to generate the discount event.
+
[,console]
----
$ ./summarize.sh ContinuousView

$ cat data/ContinuousView/snowplow-enriched-good.summary-by-kt.json | jq .
----
+
.. Alternatively, you can summarize by using a different implementation (written in {JavaScript}).
This is useful to double check if {Java} implementation is correct.
+
----
$ version=js ./summarize.sh ContinuousView

$ cat data/ContinuousView/snowplow-enriched-good.summary-by-js.json | jq .
----
+
.. [[diff-between-summaries]] *It should be obvious that summarisation, regardless of the algorithm, should produce the same result for the same set of events. So, test this with the following command:*
+
[,console]
----
$ ./diff-between-summaries.sh ContinuousView
----
+
... You should not see any results in the output of the above command. However, there may be a minor difference in the formatting of some timestamps presented.

<<<
=== Restarting the topics

. To execute the next test and get only the date related to it, you need to restart the topics:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./restart-topics.sh
----
. At this point, if you had a terminal open to display the discounts-processor logs, you will need to reopen it.

<<<
=== Testing the MostViewedProcessor

. Start testing the `MostViewed` processor:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./test.sh MostViewed
----
+
. Wait about 5 minutes (since this is a end-to-end testing by simulating the real user behaviour).
. Up to this point, this should be the data already generated:
+
----
$ tree data/
data/
|-- ContinuousView
|   |-- shopper-discounts.jsonl
|   |-- shopper-discounts.rpk.jsonl
|   |-- snowplow-enriched-good.jsonl
|   |-- snowplow-enriched-good.rpk.jsonl
|   |-- snowplow-enriched-good.summary-by-js.json
|   `-- snowplow-enriched-good.summary-by-kt.json
|-- ContinuousView.log
`-- MostViewed.log

2 directories, 8 files
----

==== Saving and analysing the generated data

. Save the data generated in the topics and check it:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./save-data.sh MostViewed

$ cat data/MostViewed/snowplow-enriched-good.jsonl

$ !! | jq .
----
+
. The discount event, if it has been successfully generated, can be viewed with this command:
+
----
$ cat data/MostViewed/shopper-discounts.jsonl | jq .
----
+
. Use the `summarize.sh` script:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./summarize.sh MostViewed
$ cat data/MostViewed/snowplow-enriched-good.summary-by-kt.json | jq .

$ version=js ./summarize.sh MostViewed
$ cat data/MostViewed/snowplow-enriched-good.summary-by-js.json | jq .
----
+
. <<diff-between-summaries,As done previously>>, check if there is any differences between the generated summaries:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./diff-between-summaries.sh MostViewed
----

<<<
[[expected-final-results]]
== Expected final results

As final results of this end-to-end test it is expected that:

. The following directory and file structure has been generated on your machine:
+
[,console]
----
$ tree data/
data/
|-- ContinuousView
|   |-- shopper-discounts.jsonl
|   |-- shopper-discounts.rpk.jsonl
|   |-- snowplow-enriched-good.jsonl
|   |-- snowplow-enriched-good.rpk.jsonl
|   |-- snowplow-enriched-good.summary-by-js.json
|   `-- snowplow-enriched-good.summary-by-kt.json
|-- ContinuousView.log
|-- MostViewed
|   |-- shopper-discounts.jsonl
|   |-- shopper-discounts.rpk.jsonl
|   |-- snowplow-enriched-good.jsonl
|   |-- snowplow-enriched-good.rpk.jsonl
|   |-- snowplow-enriched-good.summary-by-js.json
|   `-- snowplow-enriched-good.summary-by-kt.json
`-- MostViewed.log

3 directories, 14 files
----
+
. Discount events must have been generated and must be available in the `shopper-discounts.jsonl` files.
. The content of the `snowplow-enriched-good.summary-by-*.json` files should be practically the same (minor differences may occur).
