= User Behavior Simulator
Paulo Jer√¥nimo
include::common/head.adoc[]

:uri-tracker: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/node-js-tracker/

A tool to simulate different user behaviors for product viewing in an e-commerce environment, sending events to Snowplow collector or Kafka topic.

toc::[]

== Overview

This simulator generates different patterns of product viewing behavior:

* Frequent views of the same product
* Long duration views
* Normal browsing patterns

There are two modes for sending events:

* Snowplow - Sends events directly to a Snowplow collector
** All events are tracked using the Snowplow {uri-tracker}[Node.js Tracker] and sent to a local collector.
* Kafka - Sends events to a Kafka topic
** Events are generated as JSON and sent to a Kafka topic.

== Event Structure

The simulator (for Snowplow mode) generates Snowplow ecommerce events with the following schema:

* Event: `product_view`
* Schema: `iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow.ecommerce/product_view/jsonschema/1-0-0`
* Context: Product information using `iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow.ecommerce/product/jsonschema/1-0-0`

== Prerequisites

. Docker installed
. Node.js installed
. npm or yarn package manager
. For Snowplow mode:
.. A running Snowplow collector (default: `http://localhost:9090`)
. For Kafka (Redpanda) mode:
.. A running Kafka broker (default: `localhost:19092`)

== Usage

=== Kafka mode

. Step 1: Start the Redpanda services:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./run.sh redpanda up
----
. Step 2: Watch the logs for the `discounts-processor` service:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./run.sh redpanda logs
----
+
. Step 3: Run the simulator in `kafka` mode:
.. To run the simulator in `long` mode, type:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./run.sh long kafka
----
+
.. To run the simulator in `frequent` mode, type:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./run.sh frequent kafka
----
+
TIP: The `normal` mode is also available.
+
. Step 4: Stop the Redpanda services:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./run.sh redpanda down
----

== Configuration

To configure aspects such as Snowplow collector endpoint, Kafka broker, and user behavior patterns, copy the file `config.sample.js` to `config.js` and edit it as needed.
