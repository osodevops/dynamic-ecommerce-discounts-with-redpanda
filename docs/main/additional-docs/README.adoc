= Additional docs

The documentation for this project is designed to be modular, just like all of its code.
Therefore, this topic serves as a summary to help you find these additional documents.
You can always run a `find . -name README.sh` command from the project root to locate all the scripts that generates additional documents.

Anyway, here are links to the additional documents:

* [[discounts-processor-doc]] *discounts-processor-doc*: link:../../discounts-processor/README{outfilesuffix}[Discounts Processor Implementation]
* [[docker-doc]] *docker-doc*: link:../../docker/README{outfilesuffix}[Some docker commands used in this project]
