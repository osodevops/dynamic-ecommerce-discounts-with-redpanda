* [[ecommerce-nextjs-example-store]] The *{uri-ecommerce-nextjs-example-store}[ecommerce-nextjs-example-store]* is a Next.js application that generates tracking events.
* [[stream-collector]] The *stream-collector* component sends these events via Kinesis to the *<<snowbridge>>* component.
* [[snowbridge]] The *snowbridge* component enriches these events, inserts more information (via *<<enrich>>* component), and sends them to <<redpanda>>.
** [[enrich]] Read more about the *enrich* component here: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/enrichment-components/enrich-kinesis/.
** Read more about the *snowbridge* component here: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/destinations/forwarding-events/snowbridge/.
* [[redpanda]] The *redpanda* broker is receives the events from <<snowbridge>>.
* For the following components, read details in the <<discounts-processor-doc>>:
** [[ContinuousViewProcessor]] The *ContinuousViewProcessor* component implements <<the-first-processor,the first processor>>.
** [[MostViewedProcessor]] The *MostViewedProcessor* component implements <<the-second-processor,the second processor>>.
** [[DiscountEventSender]] The *DiscountEventSender* component implements <<the-event-back-to-snowplow,the way to send an event back to Snowplow>>.
*** Please, also read the additional <<schemas-doc>>.

All components in this <<architecture>> run as Docker containers via `docker compose`:

* [[compose-localstack]] The infrastructure to provide the AWS resources locally (Kinesis, DyanmoDB, etc) is created by {LocalStack}, in the file `compose.localstack.yaml`.
* [[compose-snowplow]] The Snowplow's components (*<<stream-collector>>*, *<<enrich>>*, *<<snowbridge>> and <<iglu-server>>*) are defined in the file `compose.snowplow.yaml`.
* [[compose-repanda]] Redpanda's infrastructure is provided by the file `compose.redpanda.yaml`.
* [[compose-ecommerce-nextjs]] The fron end application (*<<ecommerce-nextjs-example-store>>*) is defined in the file `compose.ecommerce-nextjs.yaml`.
* [[compose-discounts-processor]] The *<<ContinuousViewProcessor>>*, *<<MostViewedProcessor>>* and *<<DiscountEventSender>>* components executed by {KafkaStreams} which executes a Java application running by Docker through the configuration in the file `compose.discounts-processor.yaml`.
