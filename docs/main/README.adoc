= Dynamic Ecommerce Discounts with Redpanda
include::common/head.adoc[]

== Introduction

This project is a companion to the {ecommerce-nextjs-example-store}.

It allows you to test this demo locally, using {LocalStack}, and in the cloud (AWS (via Terraform) or {DevContainers} (read <<localstack-devcontainers>>)).

****
[.lead.text-center]
Even the development of this project can be done entirely in the cloud because it uses {DevContainers} in {GitHubCodeSpaces}.
This way, you only need a browser to get started! +
{empty} +
*Watch the <<introduction-video>> for details.*
****

Its <<architecture>> is designed so a developer can quickly and easily set up these two environments and test the project.

[[architecture]]
== Architecture

* [[ecommerce-nextjs-example-store]] The *{uri-ecommerce-nextjs-example-store}[ecommerce-nextjs-example-store]* is a Next.js application that generates tracking events.
* [[stream-collector]] The *stream-collector* component sends these events via Kinesis to the *<<snowbridge>>* component.
* [[snowbridge]] The *snowbridge* component enriches these events, inserts more information (via *<<enrich>>* component), and sends them to <<redpanda>>.
** [[enrich]] Read more about the *enrich* component here: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/enrichment-components/enrich-kinesis/.
** Read more about the *snowbridge* component here: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/destinations/forwarding-events/snowbridge/.
* [[redpanda]] The *redpanda* broker is receives the events from use [[redpanda-connector]] (aka Bethos) to apply the dynamic discounts.
* [[redpanda-connector]] The *redpanda-connector* ...

*Sequence Diagram* for the <<architecture>>:

[.text-center]
*TODO*
//image:architecture.png[]

All components in this <<architecture>> run as Docker containers via `docker compose`:

* [[compose-snowplow]] The Snowplow's components (*<<stream-collector>>*, *<<enrich>>*, and *<<snowbridge>>*) are defined in the file `compose.snowplow.yaml`.
* [[compose-repanda]] Redpanda's infrastructure is provided by the file `compose.redpanda.yaml`.
* [[compose-apps]] The apps components (*<<ecommerce-nextjs-example-store>>*) are defined in the file `compose.apps.yaml`.
* [[compose-localstack]] The infrastructure to provide the AWS resources locally (Kinesis, DyanmoDB, etc) is created by {LocalStack}.
** Read the file `compose.localstack.yaml`.
* [[terraform]] These components and resources are created in AWS using Terraform scripts.
** There is another document, in `docs/terraform` folder, explaining the details.

== Prerequisites

=== Without {DevContainers}

. Start a new Ubuntu Linux terminal (it can be running on a WSL2 environment, or <<introduction-video,even in the cloud>>).
. Make sure you have docker (and docker compose) installed.
. Clone this project with Git and cd to it.
. Create a file `docker/.env` (from `docker/.env.sample`) and configure the AWS variables on it.

NOTE: You don't need Java or Node.js configured on your machine to follow the steps below.
*You only need a Bash terminal and a Docker installation.*

=== With {DevContainers}

*TODO*

[[steps]]
== Steps (to run this application as is)
:numbered!:

[[step1]]
=== Step 1 -> Start the containers

[,console]
----
$ ./docker/up.sh
----

[TIP]
.Tips:
====
. You can press kbd:[Ctrl+C] at any time. The docker containers will remain running.
. If there is no file `docker/.env` in the project, this script will try to locate it in a file named `../{project-name}.env` and copy it to `docker/.env`.
This allows you to call `git clean -fdX` at any time you want without losing your configuration.
.. If the file `../{project-name}.env` does not exists, it will copy the file `docker/.env.sample` to `docker/.env` and use it.
. You can pass "services" as an argument option to this script. It will list the options you can pass to it by adding the suffix "-services":
+
[,console]
----
$ ./docker/up.sh services
apps
localstack
redpanda
snowplow
----
+
. By adding the "-services" to one of the options listed above, you will start only the services listed in the file `copose.<service>.yaml`.
So, this will start only the redpanda services (services listed in `compose.redpanda.yaml`):
+
[,console]
----
$ ./docker/up.sh redpanda-services
----
+
. You can also call the script `up.sh` by using the `compose.sh` script this way:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./docker/compose.sh up
----
====

[[step2]]
=== Step 2 -> Know the URL provided by the services

. *LocalStack*: https://app.localstack.cloud <- [[localstack]] localstack
. *Redpanda*: 
.. *Internal (docker containers access)* http://localhost:9092 <- [[redpanda-internal]] redpanda-internal
.. *Console*: http://localhost:8080 <- [[redpanda-console]] redpanda-console
... User / password: jane / some-other-secret-password
. *Ecommerce store*: http://localhost:3000 <- [[ecommerce-store]] ecommerce-store
.. It connects with *Snowplow collector* configured to run in http://localhost:9090 <- [[snowplow-collector]] snowplow-collector

[[step3]]
=== Step 3 -> Browse the application pages
:uri-page-view-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/page-views/
:uri-product-view-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#product-view
:uri-internal-promotion-view-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#promotion-view
:uri-internal-promotion-click-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#promotion-click
:uri-product-list-view-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#product-list-view
:uri-product-list-click-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#product-list-click
:uri-add-to-cart-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#add-to-cart
:uri-checkout-step-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#checkout-step
:uri-transaction-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#transaction
:uri-enriched-tsv-format: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/fundamentals/canonical-event/understanding-the-enriched-tsv-format/
:uri-raw-messages-dir: {uri-project-github}/tree/main/scripts/raw-messages.sample
:uri-images-dir: {uri-project-github}/tree/main/docs/main/images

As expected, in the <<ecommerce-store>>, during every page navigation, we are tracking a {uri-page-view-event}[page view] event.

For ecommerce interactions we track the following:

* When a customer goes to a product page we track a {uri-product-view-event}[product view] event.
* When a customer sees an internal promotion list, e.g. Homepage promotions, we track an {uri-internal-promotion-view-event}[internal promotion view] event.
* When a customer clicks an internal promotion, we track an {uri-internal-promotion-click-event}[internal promotion click] event.
* When a customer goes to a product list page, we track a {uri-product-list-view-event}[product list view] event.
* When a customer clicks a product on a product list page, we track a {uri-product-list-click-event}[product list click] event.
* When a customer sees a recommended product list on the product page, we track a {uri-product-list-view-event}[product list view] event.
* When a customer clicks on a recommended product list on the product page, we track a {uri-product-list-click-event}[product list click] event.
* When the customer adds a product to the cart, we track an {uri-add-to-cart-event}[add to cart] event.
* When the customer goes to the cart page we track a {uri-checkout-step-event}[checkout step] event.
* When they go to the payment step, another {uri-checkout-step-event}[checkout step] event is tracked.
* When the customer successfully completes a transaction, we track a {uri-transaction-event}[transaction] event (triggered on the server-side but formulated with the spec of Snowplow ecommerce)

[[step4]]
=== Step 4 -> Access the redpanda-console and check the generated events

After browsing the [[ecommerce-store]], you can access the [[redpanda-console]] and check the generated events in the topic `snowplow-enriched-good`.
See these images: {uri-images-dir}/redpanda-1.png[redpanda-1.png], {uri-images-dir}/redpanda-2.png[redpanda-2.png].

You can explore the data format of these events in {uri-enriched-tsv-format}[enriched TSV format].
In the {uri-raw-messages-dir}[scripts/raw-messages.sample] directory, there are examples of the events recorded by Snowplow when they are transferred to Redpanda.
These sample TSV files were created by running the script {uri-project-github}/tree/main/scripts/extract-snowplow-raw-messages.sh[extract-snowplow-raw-messages.sh].
Note: _these are not the events final format of the events sent from <<snowbridge>> component to <<redpanda>>_.

[[stepX]]
=== Step N -> (optional) Use {LazyDocker} to monitor the containers and logs

[,console]
----
$ ./docker/compose.sh lazy

== Clean up steps
:numbered!:

[[cleanup-step1]]
=== Step 1 -> Stop the containers

To stop all the containers, type:

[,console]
----
$ ./docker/down.sh
----

[[cleanup-step2]]
=== Step 2 -> Clean up

To remove all the containers and images, type:

[,console]
----
$ ./docker/clean.sh
----

[WARNING]
.Warnings:
====
. The script `clean.sh` will destroy any data generated by these containers.
