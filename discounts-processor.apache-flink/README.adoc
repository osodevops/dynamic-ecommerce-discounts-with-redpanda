== Overview

This project (*{doctitle}*) is a Java/ {ApacheFlink} application that processes event data from {Redpanda} and generates <<output-events,discount events>> based on some <<rules,conditions>>.
So, based on the <<input-events,input events>>, it analyzes if the user is able to get discounts.

*-> PROJECT STATUS: INCOMPLETE AND NOT WORKING PROPERLY<-*

Issues:

. <<continuous-view-discount-processor,Continuous View Discount Processor>>: It has problems regarding watermark management.
. <<most-viewed-product-discount-processor,Most Viewed Product Discount Processor>>: Incomplete.

[[main-project-relation]]
This module can be treated almost{empty}footnote:[It only relies on scripts that generate documentation.] entirely independently of {uri-project-github}[the main project] that encompasses it. It is an alternative intended to produce the same result as the {uri-project-github-connect-yaml}[connect.yaml] file configured using {RedpandaConnect}. In other words, it is a discount processor that works under the same <<rules,rules>>.

The tests in this module are <<unit-tests,unit tests>> and {integration-tests}.
Some of them are written in {Kotlin} following the {BehaviourSpec} provided by {Kotest} framework.

The {integration-tests} developed are executed with the help of {TestContainers}.

[[rules]]
== Discount Conditions

[[continuous-view-discount]]
=== Continuous View Discount

A single discount of 10% (witin a 5-minute window) is generated when:

* A user views the same product continuously within a 90-second window.

[[most-viewed-product-discount]]
=== Most Viewed Product Discount

==== Basic Rules
For each user, a 10% discount is generated for their most viewed product within a fixed 5-minute window.

==== Detailed Specifications

===== Time Window
* Fixed 5-minute windows (00:00-00:05, 00:05-00:10, etc.)
* Discount evaluation occurs at the end of each window
* Events are processed based on their `collector_tstamp`

===== Event Flow
1. A `product_view` event initiates a viewing session
2. Subsequent `page_ping` events for that product are counted
3. Session continues until another `product_view` event occurs
4. Process repeats for the new product

===== View Counting
* Minimum threshold: 3 views within the window
* Only `page_ping` events count towards view totals
* View duration is calculated using `page_ping` timestamps

===== Discount Generation
* Scope: Per user
* Generated at window end
* One discount per user per window
* Cooldown: 5-minute period per user after receiving any discount

===== Tiebreaker Rules
If a user has multiple products with the same number of views:
1. Product with longest total viewing time wins
2. If still tied, first product viewed wins

.Example Timeline (for user "U1")
[%header,cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Time |Event |Effect
|10:00:00 |Window starts |
|10:00:10 |`product_view` P1 |Start tracking P1
|10:00:15-00:45 |4 `page_ping` P1 |P1: 4 views
|10:01:00 |`product_view` P2 |Start tracking P2
|10:01:05-01:50 |6 `page_ping` P2 |P2: 6 views
|10:02:00 |`product_view` P1 |Start tracking P1 again
|10:02:05-02:30 |3 `page_ping` P1 |P1: total 7 views
|10:05:00 |Window ends |P1 wins (7 views)

== Running the application

=== Prerequisites

. Bash
. Java
. {Docker}

=== Version Information

These were the versions used during development:

[,console]
----
$ echo $BASH_VERSION
5.2.21(1)-release

$ java --version
openjdk 21.0.6 2025-01-21 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-21.0.6+7 (build 21.0.6+7-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-21.0.6+7 (build 21.0.6+7-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)

$ docker --version
Docker version 27.3.1, build ce12230
----

[NOTE]
====
The first {ApacheFlink} version supporting Java 21 is 1.19.2 (see its https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.19/release-notes/flink-1.19/[Release Notes]).
Currently, the Flink's version used by this project can be found by this command:

[,console]
----
$ sed -n 's/val flinkVersion = "\(.*\)"/\1/p' build.gradle.kts
1.20.1
----
====

=== Running manually

==== Starting Redpanda

[[redpanda-start]]
First, you need to start Redpanda using `docker compose`:

----
$ docker compose -f compose.redpanda.yaml up -d # <- ./redpanda.sh up
----

[TIP]
====
When you're done, use this command to stop Redpanda and remove all data:
----
$ docker compose -f compose.redpanda.yaml down -v --remove-orphans # <- ./redpanda.sh down
----
====

==== Running the application

The application can be executed using the provided link:run.sh[] script, which handles building and running the application:

Start the application with an existing JAR:

[,console]
----
$ ./run.sh
----

[TIP]
====
You can force a rebuild before running the application:

[,console]
----
$ ./run.sh --build
----
====

The `run.sh` script will:

* Build the application if the JAR doesn't exist or if `--build` is specified
* Configure appropriate JVM options
* Handle graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
* Display colored status messages during execution

NOTE: The script automatically manages the application lifecycle and provides proper cleanup on shutdown.

[[generating-events]]
==== Generating events

To generate events in order to trigger discounts, use {uri-project-github-simulator}[the Simulator project].
You can use it to generate events (containing `product_view` and `page_ping` events in JSONL format) and send them to Redpanda.

So, the file link:data-samples/continuous.jsonl[] is an example of such a file.
You can send the events in this file to the input topic using the following command:

[,console]
----
$ docker exec -i redpanda rpk topic produce snowplow-enriched-good < \
  data-samples/continuous.jsonl # <- ./redpanda.sh produce
----

[NOTE]
====
Using the `tstamp-diff.sh` script (available in main project) you can verify that the time difference between the collector timestamps for the `page_ping` events in this file is greater than 90 seconds as per the rule. Therefore, these `page_ping` events on it should generate a discount event according to <<continuous-view-discount,the rule>>.

[,console]
----
$ {
  f=data-samples/continuous.jsonl
  start=$(sed -n 2p $f | jq -r .collector_tstamp)
  end=$(sed -n 11p $f | jq -r .collector_tstamp)
  ../scripts/tstamp-diff.sh $start $end
}

----
====

[[verifying-discounts]]
==== Verifying discounts

To verify that discounts are being generated correctly, consume from the output topic:

[,console]
----
$ docker exec -it redpanda rpk topic consume shopper-discounts # <- ./redpanda.sh consume
----

You should see discount events in the output that match the expected patterns based on the input events.

TIP: You can also open the Redpanda console at http://localhost:8080 to observe each of the events produced in the shopper-discounts topic.

=== Running via Docker Compose

To run the application, type:

----
$ docker compose up --build -d
----

Watch the logs to ensure the application is running correctly:

----
$ docker compose logs discounts-processor -f
----

Generate events as described in <<generating-events>>.

Verify discounts as described in <<verifying-discounts>>.

To stop the application and remove the containers, type:

----
$ docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
----

[[testing-procedures]]
== Testing procedures

[[unit-tests]]
=== Unit tests

Unit tests verify the core business logic of the discount processors without external dependencies.

To run all unit and mock tests:

[,console]
----
$ ./gradlew test
----

TIP: Since all tests are mocked, there is no need to start Redpanda.

[[mock-tests]]
=== Mock Tests

These are the two mock tests created for the {discount-processors}:

* [[continuous-view-discount-mock-test]] link:src/test/kotlin/com/example/processor/ContinuousViewProcessorTest.kt[]::
* [[most-viewed-product-discount-mock-test]] link:src/test/kotlin/com/example/processor/MostViewedProcessorTest.kt[]::

To run a specific test class (e.g., link:src/test/kotlin/com/example/serialization/DiscountEventSerializationSchemaTest.kt[DiscountEventSerializationSchemaTest]):

[,console]
----
$ ./gradlew test --tests "com.example.serialization.DiscountEventSerializationSchemaTest"
----

To run a mocked test for one of the two {discount-processors}:

[,console]
----
$ ./gradlew test --tests "com.example.processor.MostViewedProcessorTest"
----

[[integration-tests]]
=== Integration Tests

The integration tests cover tests for the {discount-processors} and is running with {TestContainers}.

[,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew test --tests "com.example.DiscountsProcessorIntegrationTest"
----

To run all integration tests:

[,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew integrationTest
----

<<<
[[discount-processors]]
== Discount processors

This project contains two discount processors:

[[continuous-view-discount-processor]]
link:src/main/java/com/example/processor/ContinuousViewProcessor.java[]::
Cover all the rules for the <<continuous-view-discount,Continuous View Discount>>. +
Test code: <<continuous-view-discount-mock-test,ContinuousViewProcessorTest>>

[[most-viewed-product-discount-processor]]
link:src/main/java/com/example/processor/MostViewedProcessor.java[]::
Cover all the rules for the <<most-viewed-product-discount,Most Viewed Product Discount>>. +
Test code: <<most-viewed-product-discount-mock-test,MostViewedProcessorTest>>

<<<
== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

* *Connection issues*: Verify that you <<redpanda-start,started Redpanda>>.
* *No discounts generated*: Ensure that enough events are being sent to trigger the <<rules,discount conditions>>.
* *Serialization errors*: Check that the event format matches <<event-examples,the expected schema>>.

=== Logs

Application logs can be configured in two files depending on the environment (main or test):

. link:src/main/resources/logback.xml[logback.xml]
. link:src/test/resources/logback-test.xml[logback-test.xml]
